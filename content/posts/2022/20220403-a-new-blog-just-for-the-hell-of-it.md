But why!? I suppose because I was bored this morning and because I can. Also because I was tinkering with my recent [notes.baty.net](https://notes.baty.net) site and was reminded that I like the "CodeIt" theme that it uses. I thought I'd see how it felt to create a blog from scratch using my version of that them. Turns out it felt pretty good, so here we are.

I'm feeling the weight of WordPress pushing against the inconvenience of maintaining a static blog. The past couple of days, I have found myself happier dealing with the inconvenience.
