I haven&#8217;t been using film much this year, but once in a while it&#8217;s fun to get out and shoot a roll. I took the M6 out yesterday and finally finished the roll of HP5+ that I&#8217;d loaded into it a month ago. Here are a few from the roll. Most of these were shot while out walking around the neighborhood.
