What I'm doing as of **Tuesday, April  5, 2022**

-   Moving blogs around again
-   Spending time in the darkroom
-   Trying to read more. Currently "Analogia: The Emergence of Technology Beyond Programmable Control" by George Dyson

(Thanks to [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs) for the idea of [keeping a /now page](https://nownownow.com/about) like this one.)
