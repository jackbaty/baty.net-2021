There are two small man-made ponds in my neighborhood. This morning on my walk, <mark>the full moon was reflecting beautifully</mark> off one of them and it was nice.

I've been a [put.io](https://put.io) user for 10 years, they tell me. They also, as a thank you, sent me a free year of the 1TB plan. That was nice of them.
