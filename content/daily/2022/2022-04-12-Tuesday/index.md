I've added comments here. Used [Cusdis - Lightweight, privacy-first, open-source comment system](https://cusdis.com/). It was super easy. We'll see how it feels, and if I like it enough once they start charging for the hosted option. I don't think I'm interested in self-hosting. My feelings about comments are usually mixed. I like having them available, but almost no one comments, so it ends up being mostly overhead. Plus, I prefer getting emails from people to drive-by comments.
