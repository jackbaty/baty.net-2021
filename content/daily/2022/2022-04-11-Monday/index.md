I shot a roll with the Hasselblad yesterday. <mark>It was disappointing.</mark> I had more trouble than I remember with focusing. And a third of the frames were underexposed. I need more practice. I've now swapped out the split prism focusing screen for the plain matte (Acute Matte D) version. That should help. Here's my favorite from the roll...

It bothers me a little that I don't know <mark>how the "image" plugin works</mark> in Hugo. It solves the problem with relative URLs when referencing images when using page bundles, but I don't know how.

I need to learn that when I'm about to take a photo and the light looks boring, <mark>the photo will be boring</mark>. Every time.

The things I care about are changing. I <mark>care less and less</mark> about the things everyone else seems to cares more and more about. Is it just my usual zagging?
