I shot a roll with the Hasselblad yesterday. <mark>It was disappointing.</mark> I had more trouble than I remember with focusing. And a third of the frames were underexposed. I need more practice, but I also swapped out the focusing screen for the completely matte version rather than the split prism. That should help. Here's my favorite from the roll...

It bothers me a little that I don't know <mark>how the "image" plugin works</mark> in Hugo. It solves the problem with relative URLs when referencing images when using page bundles, but I don't know how.

I need to learn that when I'm about to take a photo and the light looks boring, <mark>the photo will be boring</mark>. Every time.
