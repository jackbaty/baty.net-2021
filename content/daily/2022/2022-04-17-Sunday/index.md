I don't see how anyone who has acquired more than a <mark>passing familiarity with Org mode</mark> would ever choose to write anything in Markdown. It's not fair that the only real tooling for Org is Emacs.

There's a subtle difference between <mark>what I want to say and what I want to share</mark>. The things I want to say but not force on people go here in these daily posts. Shared things go on social media and as posts below.
