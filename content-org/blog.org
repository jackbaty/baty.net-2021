The concern I have about {{{mark(using Doom Emacs)}}} is that I'm not really learning how to use Emacs, but rather how to use Doom. But damn it's fast and improves just about every aspect of Emacs.

How do I tell Instagram to {{{mark(stop notifying me)}}} that "so-and-so has added to their story"? I want /some/ notifications, just not those.

I took another look at [[https://notion.so][Notion]] and still find it to be an overwrought mess.

I like being able to {{{mark(write in an outline)}}}, but I don't like being /forced/ to. Hence my disillusionment with Roam and Logseq.

Remember when I used to work here? Hell, I /owned/ the place :).

Severence is the best thing on TV.

I should take a closer look at [[https://sr.ht/][sourcehut]]

Trying [[https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds][jimeh/emacs-builds: Self-contained Emacs.app builds for macOS, with native-compilation support in nightly builds.]] Rather than the emacs-mac package. *UPDATE* Nope, doesn't work yet on M1 Macs.

**** DONE Comparing film and digital: Mom :@Photography:Leica:Analog:Film:

I had lunch with my parents recently and took a few photos with both my film and digital cameras. I shot about the same number of photos with each camera, with close to the same number of "keepers". Which do I prefer?

#+hugo: more

Here I'm showing one of each, digital and film, of my favorite from the visit.

{{{img(MomFilm.jpg, Film: Leica MP (HP5 Plus))}}}

@@html:{{< image src="MomDigital.jpg" caption="Digital: Leica M10-R (B&W conversion in Silver Efex)" >}}@@

I prefer the film image. I manipulated the digital shot in Silver Efex Pro and added a bit of grain to try and get the look I like, but I still prefer the film image.

The difference might be partially due to using the 50mm Summilux on the MP. It's my favorite lens. The digital shot was with the 35mm Summilux. Also a great lens, but lacks that certain "something" of the 50.

I don't think the lens difference explains it, though. A large part of what makes me prefer film photos is just /knowing/ they're film photos. That means something to me, and influences how I respond to an image. One could probably use a decent HP5 preset on that image in Lightroom and I wouldn't be able to tell it from a film photo in a blind test, but I don't view my images that way. I know how they were made, and it matters.

Additionally, I can make beautiful silver gelatin prints of the film photo in my darkroom. That's important, too.

I'll probably always shoot both film and digital, but more often than not I prefer the results I get from film.

**** DONE A new blog just for the hell of it :@Blogging:Hugo:

Here we are, running the show as a static blog, using Hugo. But why!? I suppose because I was bored and because it's fun.

#+hugo: more

Also because while tinkering with my [[https://notes.baty.net][notes.baty.net]] site I was reminded that I like the "[[https://github.com/jackbaty/CodeIT][CodeIt]]" theme that it uses. I thought I'd see how it felt to create a blog from scratch using my version of that theme. Turns out it felt pretty good, so here we are.

I grew tired of pushing against the weight of WordPress.  The inconvenience of maintaining a static blog seemed like a fair trade. The past couple of days, I have found myself happier dealing with the inconvenience.

**** DONE Some unremarkable pens the Internet made me buy :@Analog:Gear:

:END:
I'm an impressionable young man, and when I notice someone on The Internet raving about something, I want to feel that way, too. I often order whatever that thing is, only to be disappointed. For example, here are a few of the pens I bought after being told how remarkable they are. They're not that remarkable.
