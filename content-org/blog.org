*** DONE A new blog just for the hell of it :@Blogging:Hugo:

Here we are, running the show as a static blog, using Hugo. But why!? I suppose because I was bored and because it's fun. Also because while tinkering with my [[https://notes.baty.net][notes.baty.net]] site I was reminded that I like the "[[https://github.com/jackbaty/CodeIT][CodeIt]]" theme that it uses. I thought I'd see how it felt to create a blog from scratch using my version of that theme. Turns out it felt pretty good, so here we are.

I grew tired of pushing against the weight of WordPress.  The inconvenience of maintaining a static blog seemed like a fair trade. The past couple of days, I have found myself happier dealing with the inconvenience.

*** DONE Some unremarkable pens the Internet made me buy :@Analog:

I'm an impressionable young man, and when I notice someone on The Internet raving about something, I want to feel that way, too. I often order whatever that thing is, only to be disappointed. For example, here are a few of the pens I bought after being told how remarkable they are. They're not that remarkable.
