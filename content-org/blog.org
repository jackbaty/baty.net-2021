I shot a roll with the Hasselblad yesterday. {{{mark(It was disappointing.)}}} I had more trouble than I remember with focusing. And a third of the frames were underexposed. I need more practice, but I also swapped out the focusing screen for the completely matte version rather than the split prism. That should help. Here's my favorite from the roll...

It bothers me a little that I don't know {{{mark(how the "image" plugin works)}}} in Hugo. It solves the problem with relative URLs when referencing images when using page bundles, but I don't know how.

I need to learn that when I'm about to take a photo and the light looks boring, {{{mark(the photo will be boring)}}}. Every time.

Good morning. After sleeping on the decision to bring my daily notes into the main blog, I don't hate it. I thought I might, but so far it seems like a good move.

This is how NFTs make me feel: like the future is useless but expensive, and world-altering technology is now in the hands of a culture so aesthetically and spiritually impoverished that it should maybe go back to telling stories around the cooking fire for a while, just to remember how to mean something.

The concern I have about {{{mark(using Doom Emacs)}}} is that I'm not really learning how to use Emacs, but rather how to use Doom. But damn it's fast and improves just about every aspect of Emacs.

How do I tell Instagram to {{{mark(stop notifying me)}}} that "so-and-so has added to their story"? I want /some/ notifications, just not those.

I took another look at [[https://notion.so][Notion]] and still find it to be an overwrought mess.

I like being able to {{{mark(write in an outline)}}}, but I don't like being /forced/ to. Hence my disillusionment with Roam and Logseq.

Remember when I used to work here? Hell, I /owned/ the place :).

There's no way I'm going to fall in love with [[https://www.warp.dev/][Warp: The terminal for the 21st century]], because I'm 100% sure they will be charging a subscription at some point and that the one feature I really want will be behind a paywall. Also, having to create and log into an "account" just to use my terminal makes me uncomfortable. Cool app, though.

I recently read Joe McNally's book, [[https://www.amazon.com/Real-Deal-Field-Working-Photographer/dp/1681988011/][The Real Deal: Field Notes from the Life of a Working Photographer]]. While I found his anecdotes occasionally interesting, I didn't really enjoy the book. I think this was because I don't much care for McNally's photographs. Here's one of his portraits.

{{{img(McnallyPortrait.png, Photo by Joe McNally)}}}

There's no question that McNally is a talented photographer with a powerful work ethic and serious technical skills. His portraits, however, leave me uninspired. You know the style. Creatively lit with a handful of Speedlights, carefully arranged backgrounds or sets, wardrobe and makeup people, etc. The kinds of photos that get a shit ton of likes. This style is not for me.

Now, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Joy_Ross][Judith Joy Ross]], on the other hand, makes deeply moving, personal portraits while wandering around with an 8x10 view camera. I wasn't familiar with her work until recently. I mean, just look at these...

Now that I've moved my blog back to a static site generated with [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]], I noticed that I was writing both my [[https://daily.baty.net][Daily notes]] and my blog posts in side-by-side Emacs buffers. It got me thinking about consolidating my sites even further.

#+hugo: more

The challenge was that I didn't want to simply shuffle the daily posts in with the "regular" posts. I wanted a "Daily" section. But, I also wanted today's Daily post to show on the home page, since that's where the action is.

I'm the first to admit the Hugo's templating system is a complete mystery to me. I've been using Hugo for /years/ and I still don't know what gets rendered where or how. I mostly just throw stuff at the wall until something sticks.

After several hours of Google and wild guesses, I've gotten it close enough to publish. You're soaking in it. The home page shows the most recent post in the =/daily/= folder. Then at [[https://baty.net/daily/][baty.net/daily/]] I show a reverse-chronological list of daily posts.

I've added a couple of tweaks. The list of Daily posts differs from the home page in that I display the full posts and not just the "summary". That was surprisingly difficult to wrangle.

I have a new attribute in the front matter, =weather=, which is displayed on daily posts. This lets me display the weather differently from the posts' content. The cool feature here is that I'm adding the weather attribute automatically when creating new posts. I create posts using YASnippet, which can call custom functions at the time of expansion. Here's my "daily" snippet:

#+begin_src org
  # -*- mode: snippet -*-
  # name: Hugo Daily Post
  # key: daily
  # uuid: daily
  # --
  *** TODO ${1:title} :@Daily:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_HUGO_BUNDLE: `(format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d-%A")`
  :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: index
  :EXPORT_HUGO_SLUG: `(format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d")`
  :EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :weather "`(jab/insert-weather)`"
  :END:

  $0
#+end_src

Note the =:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :weather "`(jab/insert-weather)`"= property. I have a custom function called =jab/insert-weather= which calls the =wttr= service and outputs the current weather conditions. Surrounding the function with backticks causes the function to be evaluated while the snippet is expanded. Neat! Note that I also dynamically generate the filenames based on the current date.

This all means that, in my posts.org file, I can type =daily= and hit tab, enter the title, and I'm ready to publish.

I had lunch with my parents recently and took a few photos with both my film and digital cameras. I shot about the same number of photos with each camera, with close to the same number of "keepers". Which do I prefer?

#+hugo: more

Here I'm showing one of each, digital and film, of my favorite from the visit.

{{{img(MomFilm.jpg, Film: Leica MP (HP5 Plus))}}}

@@html:{{< image src="MomDigital.jpg" caption="Digital: Leica M10-R (B&W conversion in Silver Efex)" >}}@@

I prefer the film image. I manipulated the digital shot in Silver Efex Pro and added a bit of grain to try and get the look I like, but I still prefer the film image.

The difference might be partially due to using the 50mm Summilux on the MP. It's my favorite lens. The digital shot was with the 35mm Summilux. Also a great lens, but lacks that certain "something" of the 50.

I don't think the lens difference explains it, though. A large part of what makes me prefer film photos is just /knowing/ they're film photos. That means something to me, and influences how I respond to an image. One could probably use a decent HP5 preset on that image in Lightroom and I wouldn't be able to tell it from a film photo in a blind test, but I don't view my images that way. I know how they were made, and it matters.

Additionally, I can make beautiful silver gelatin prints of the film photo in my darkroom. That's important, too.

I'll probably always shoot both film and digital, but more often than not I prefer the results I get from film.

Here we are, running the show as a static blog, using Hugo. But why!? I suppose because I was bored and because it's fun.

#+hugo: more

Also because while tinkering with my [[https://notes.baty.net][notes.baty.net]] site I was reminded that I like the "[[https://github.com/jackbaty/CodeIT][CodeIt]]" theme that it uses. I thought I'd see how it felt to create a blog from scratch using my version of that theme. Turns out it felt pretty good, so here we are.

I grew tired of pushing against the weight of WordPress.  The inconvenience of maintaining a static blog seemed like a fair trade. The past couple of days, I have found myself happier dealing with the inconvenience.

I'm an impressionable young man, and when I notice someone on The Internet raving about something, I want to feel that way, too. I often order whatever that thing is, only to be disappointed. For example, here are a few of the pens I bought after being told how remarkable they are. They're not that remarkable.
