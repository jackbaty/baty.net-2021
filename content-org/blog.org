But why!? I suppose because I was bored this morning and because I can. Also because I was tinkering with my recent [[https://notes.baty.net][notes.baty.net]] site and was reminded that I like the "CodeIt" theme that it uses. I thought I'd see how it felt to create a blog from scratch using my version of that them. Turns out it felt pretty good, so here we are.

I'm feeling the weight of WordPress pushing against the inconvenience of maintaining a static blog. The past couple of days, I have found myself happier dealing with the inconvenience.

*** DONE Some unremarkable pens the Internet made me buy :@Analog:

I'm an impressionable young man, and when I notice someone on The Internet raving about something, I want to feel that way, too. I often order whatever that thing is, only to be disappointed. For example, here are a few of the pens I bought after being told how great they were. The're not.

I created this site as a place to capture the things Iâ€™m thinking about throughout each day.

There isnâ€™t a specific topic, or trend, or brand, or goal here. It can be pretty mundane.
