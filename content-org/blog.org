I never watched "{{{mark(The Sopranos)}}}" in its heyday. I started the first season this week. I can see the appeal, but I don't know if I care enough (after 7 episodes) to spend the time on six seasons of a TV show.

Wanting an app to be basically a wrapper over {{{mark(a set of Markdown files)}}} in a folder is fine, but as a requirement it's a silly place to draw a line.

If I could just agree with myself to {{{mark(use Emacs for most writing and note-taking)}}}, life would be a lot simpler. Even though at times I tire of living in all-text, all-the-time, the alternative of moving stuff around and having to decide where to put things all the time is a terrible way to live.

I hate how being {{{mark(addicted to the computer)}}} makes me feel.

My god we just keep {{{mark(talking about the same things)}}} over and over. Do I need a new community or is this just the world now?

I'm happy to have a {{{mark(place to vent)}}} that doesn't involve bothering everyone on social media platforms all day.

So much time in one’s cultural life before the digital revolution was spent physically flipping through things: racks of records, CDs, VHS cassettes, DVDs and books. And the very act of doing that would set mental hares running: you’d come away with the fresh desire to watch or listen or read something new. Or something old.

I've {{{mark(added comments here)}}}. Used [[https://cusdis.com/][Cusdis - Lightweight, privacy-first, open-source comment system]]. It was super easy. We'll see how it feels, and if I like it enough once they start charging for the hosted option. I don't think I'm interested in self-hosting. My feelings about comments are usually mixed. I like having them available, but almost no one comments, so it ends up being mostly overhead. Plus, I prefer getting emails from people to drive-by comments.

This Focomat IIc is going to be the death of me. I plan to try and {{{mark(adjust the autofocus mechanism)}}} myself to see if I can get it to focus throught the entire range. I've also ordered a 75 watt bulb to replace the 150W bulb to try and get exposure times up to a workable duration.

I shot a roll with the Hasselblad yesterday. {{{mark(It was disappointing.)}}} I had more trouble than I remember with focusing. And a third of the frames were underexposed. I need more practice. I've now swapped out the split prism focusing screen for the plain matte (Acute Matte D) version. That should help. Here's my favorite from the roll...

{{{img(2022-Roll-64_09.jpg, Mom and her \"butler\" Hasselblad 500C/M.)}}}

It bothers me a little that I don't know {{{mark(how the "image" plugin works)}}} in Hugo. It solves the problem with relative URLs when referencing images when using page bundles, but I don't know how.

I need to learn that when I'm about to take a photo and the light looks boring, {{{mark(the photo will be boring)}}}. Every time.

The things I care about are changing. I {{{mark(care less and less)}}} about the things everyone else seems to cares more and more about. Is it just my usual zagging?

I don't feel much like {{{mark(sitting at the computer)}}} today, but that's probably what I'll do anyway.

I recently considered {{{mark(bulk loading film)}}}, but decided against it. This decision was reinforced today when (re)reading Dante Stella:

#+begin_quote
It is not entirely clear what bulk-loading gets you here – an opportunity for scratched film, the chance to expose a bulk roll while getting into the loader, losing consecutive frame numbers, and ending up with a cassette that is either missing DX codes or pops apart if you drop it. One thing it does not get you is an actual cost advantage, especially after you spend an hour or two cleaning and loading the cassettes for each 100 foot bulk roll.

Dante Stella, [[https://themachineplanet.wordpress.com/2021/03/25/three-tired-tropes-of-analog-photography/][Three tired tropes of analog photography]]
#+end_quote

Finally finished [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci][Leonardo da Vinci by Walter Isaacson]]. That there is an impressive fella.

So it seems that Jack White is a digital sellout now, eh?

#+begin_quote
All the years of the razor blade editing gets you to a point where I don't want to waste my energy on that when I could put that energy to this now.

Jack White
#+end_quote

I'm growing weary of {{{mark(fighting with the Focomat IIc)}}}. It's such a wonderfully-built contraption that is capable of amazing enlargements, but it's behaving badly. Exposure times are in the 3-8 second range for anything but the densest negatives. What's worse, the autofocus isn't working correctly. Autofocus is kind of the whole point of this thing. I'm starting to think I should find something modern, with readily-available replacement parts. Tired of struggling with this ancient beast.

:END:

The last time I rewatched "The West Wing" I was once again  impressed by how good people were at their jobs. How /productive/ everyone was. I wondered how /I/ could be that productive.

#+hugo: more

I noticed that the entire process used by the staff seemed to be carrying around folders full of paper and barking things like "Get me the file on senator Jones and the notes from our briefing!" Within minutes they would be perusing a bunch of photos and papers scattered about a desk and they'd develop a plan right then and there. Awesome!

So, I started organizing all of my projects in manilla folders. One folder per project. I called it the "West Wing Productivity System". I'd print meeting notes, mindmaps, emails, etc and put them in the appropriate folder. I kept a single summary sheet clipped to the inside with contact information, summary info, budgets,  etc.

Whenever I needed to work on a project, I'd grab the folder, spread its contents across my desk, and get to work. It was nice knowing where everything was. It was nice being able to see everything at once, if necessary. (I had a big desk).

On the other hand, it was a pain when I needed to share something with colleagues. Search kind of sucked. And if I happened to be at home without the proper folder in my bag I was screwed.

It was fun for a while, but this was nearly 10 years ago. I still use folders, just not quite so deliberately.
Just for the hell of it, I've brought back the system for some of my home projects. There's not a lot of risk and I get to shuffle papers around again like I'm Josh's assistant or something.

I recently read Joe McNally's book, [[https://www.amazon.com/Real-Deal-Field-Working-Photographer/dp/1681988011/][The Real Deal: Field Notes from the Life of a Working Photographer]]. While I found his anecdotes occasionally interesting, I didn't really enjoy the book. I think this was because I don't much care for McNally's photographs. Here's one of his portraits.

{{{img(McnallyPortrait.png, Photo by Joe McNally)}}}

There's no question that McNally is a talented photographer with a powerful work ethic and serious technical skills. His portraits, however, leave me uninspired. You know the style. Creatively lit with a handful of Speedlights, carefully arranged backgrounds or sets, wardrobe and makeup people, etc. The kinds of photos that get a shit ton of likes. This style is not for me.

Now, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Joy_Ross][Judith Joy Ross]], on the other hand, makes deeply moving, personal portraits while wandering around with an 8x10 view camera. I wasn't familiar with her work until recently. I mean, just look at these...

Now that I've moved my blog back to a static site generated with [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]], I noticed that I was writing both my [[https://daily.baty.net][Daily notes]] and my blog posts in side-by-side Emacs buffers. It got me thinking about consolidating my sites even further.

#+hugo: more

The challenge was that I didn't want to simply shuffle the daily posts in with the "regular" posts. I wanted a "Daily" section. But, I also wanted today's Daily post to show on the home page, since that's where the action is.

I'm the first to admit the Hugo's templating system is a complete mystery to me. I've been using Hugo for /years/ and I still don't know what gets rendered where or how. I mostly just throw stuff at the wall until something sticks.

After several hours of Google and wild guesses, I've gotten it close enough to publish. You're soaking in it. The home page shows the most recent post in the =/daily/= folder. Then at [[https://baty.net/daily/][baty.net/daily/]] I show a reverse-chronological list of daily posts.

I've added a couple of tweaks. The list of Daily posts differs from the home page in that I display the full posts and not just the "summary". That was surprisingly difficult to wrangle.

I have a new attribute in the front matter, =weather=, which is displayed on daily posts. This lets me display the weather differently from the posts' content. The cool feature here is that I'm adding the weather attribute automatically when creating new posts. I create posts using YASnippet, which can call custom functions at the time of expansion. Here's my "daily" snippet:

#+begin_src org
  # -*- mode: snippet -*-
  # name: Hugo Daily Post
  # key: daily
  # uuid: daily
  # --
  *** TODO ${1:title} :@Daily:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_HUGO_BUNDLE: `(format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d-%A")`

  :EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :weather "`(jab/insert-weather)`"
  :END:

  $0
#+end_src

Note the =:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :weather "`(jab/insert-weather)`"= property. I have a custom function called =jab/insert-weather= which calls the =wttr= service and outputs the current weather conditions. Surrounding the function with backticks causes the function to be evaluated while the snippet is expanded. Neat! Note that I also dynamically generate the filenames based on the current date.

This all means that, in my posts.org file, I can type =daily= and hit tab, enter the title, and I'm ready to publish.

I had lunch with my parents recently and took a few photos with both my film and digital cameras. I shot about the same number of photos with each camera, with close to the same number of "keepers". Which do I prefer?

#+hugo: more

Here I'm showing one of each, digital and film, of my favorite from the visit.

{{{img(MomFilm.jpg, Film: Leica MP (HP5 Plus))}}}

@@html:{{< image src="MomDigital.jpg" caption="Digital: Leica M10-R (B&W conversion in Silver Efex)" >}}@@

I prefer the film image. I manipulated the digital shot in Silver Efex Pro and added a bit of grain to try and get the look I like, but I still prefer the film image.

The difference might be partially due to using the 50mm Summilux on the MP. It's my favorite lens. The digital shot was with the 35mm Summilux. Also a great lens, but lacks that certain "something" of the 50.

I don't think the lens difference explains it, though. A large part of what makes me prefer film photos is just /knowing/ they're film photos. That means something to me, and influences how I respond to an image. One could probably use a decent HP5 preset on that image in Lightroom and I wouldn't be able to tell it from a film photo in a blind test, but I don't view my images that way. I know how they were made, and it matters.

Additionally, I can make beautiful silver gelatin prints of the film photo in my darkroom. That's important, too.

I'll probably always shoot both film and digital, but more often than not I prefer the results I get from film.

Also because while tinkering with my [[https://notes.baty.net][notes.baty.net]] site I was reminded that I like the "[[https://github.com/jackbaty/CodeIT][CodeIt]]" theme that it uses. I thought I'd see how it felt to create a blog from scratch using my version of that theme. Turns out it felt pretty good, so here we are.

I grew tired of pushing against the weight of WordPress.  The inconvenience of maintaining a static blog seemed like a fair trade. The past couple of days, I have found myself happier dealing with the inconvenience.
